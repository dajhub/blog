    <description><![CDATA[Jekyll supports a range of themes and while I have tried a few I decided to use Jekyll&rsquo;s default Jekyll theme, &lsquo;Minima&rsquo;, which this site is based on. It works well out of the box. However, over time I have made a few changes.

Background Here is some additional information on my set-up.]]></description>
