This post looks at why Quantitative Easing (QE) is used by governments, how it works, and some of the criticisms levelled at QE.

## 1.0 The Bond Market & Interest Rates

Before looking at quantitative easing it is helpful to have a basic knowledge of the relationship between bond prices and interest rates.  Bonds have an inverse relationship to interest rates; when interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice-versa.

**Worked example:**

- Consider a 10-year government bond issued in 2019
- The bond has a nominal value of £5,000 and pays an annual (fixed) interest rate of £100
- The % yield on the bond is calculated by this formula:
- Yield = interest on bond / market price of the bond x 100
- Therefore if the bond trades at the initial price of £5,000
- Then the yield = (£100 / £5,000) x 100% = 2%

**A rise in market price**

- If the market price of the bond rises e.g. because of strong investor demand
- The market price of the bond rises to £5500
- The interest remains fixed at £100
- Therefore, the yield = (100/£5,500) x 100% = 1.82%
- A rise in the market price of bonds leads to a fall in the yield on a fixed-interest bond

## 2.0 Quantitative Easing

### 2.1 What Quantitative Easing (QE) involves

1. Central Bank creating money electronically.  It introduces new money into the national supply by the central bank.
2. Using this electronic money to purchase bonds (mostly government bonds).

### 2.2 When might it be used?

Quantitative easing (QE) is regarded as a last resort to stimulate spending in an economy when interest rates fail to work. Near-zero rates, together with cash hoarding by individuals, corporations and commercial banks, results in liquidity being trapped (liquidity trap) in the banking system. This was the situation that faced the Bank of Japan in 2001, when it embarked upon its QE programme – regarded as the first major QE programme by an advanced economy.

Reducing short-term interest rates to encourage spending has long been the favoured policy option of Central Banks when dealing with the threat of deflation and recession. However, if aggregate demand fails to respond to ever-lower rates, another policy must eventually be sought, which is where quantitative easing can play a part.

### 2.3 How QE works

#### 2.3.1 ***The central bank buys back bonds*** that it had previously sold to insurance companies, pension funds and commercial banks.

#### 2.3.3 The link between bond yields and mortgage rates

A question that is often asked is, "How does the bond yield affect the mortgage rate?".   Bonds affect mortgage interest rates because they compete for the same type of investors. They are both attractive to buyers who want a fixed and stable return in exchange for low risk.  

Mortgages are longer-term bonds—usually 15 or 30 years—and dependent on individual repayment.  As a result mortgages have a higher risk than most bonds.  Banks keep interest rates on mortgages a few percentage points higher than, say, government bonds. The slightly higher return are enough to push many investors toward mortgages.  Therefore, when bond yields increase mortgage rates will also increase and vice versa.

#### 2.3.4 *Diagram to show the impact on the bond market of the Central Bank using QE*

When the Central Bank buys back bonds from financial institutions there is an increase in the demand for bonds causing demand to shift from D1 to D2.  The increased demand causes an increase in the market price of bonds from P1 to P2.  This causes the yield to fall (see 1.0 above).

#### *2.3.5* *Diagram to show the impact on the money market of an increase in the money supply as a result of QE*

The money supply (MS) is fixed in the short term and is therefore vertical (inelastic).  The demand curve for money is downward sloping.  At very low interest rates the demand for money will be high and vice versa.

When QE takes place there is a shift to the right of the money supply from MS1 to MS2.  This causes an extension along the demand curve and the interest rate falls from R1 to R2.

#### 2.3.6   *Diagram to show the impact on the foreign exchange market as a result of QE*

The supply curve will shift to the right from S1 to S2, i.e. there is an increase in the supply of Stirling.  This is because 'hot money' is flowing out of the country seeking higher interest rates in other countries.  This will lower the exchange rate from E1 to E2.  The fall in the exchange rate will lead to an increase in exports and a fall in imports.  This should lead to an increase in aggregate demand given that AD=C+I+G+(X-M).

In summary, we can show the impact of quantitative easing on the AD/AS diagram.  Aggregate demand = C+I+G+(X-M).  There will be an increase in consumers consumption (C) because of lower interest rates.  Lower interest rates will also encourage firms to invest (I).  As mentioned in the last section exports (X) will increase and imports (M) will decrease.  The overall increase in aggregate demand will cause a shift outward from AD1 to AD2.  There will be inflationary pressures with the general price level increasing from P1 to P2. Real GDP has increased from Y1 to Y2.

### 2.4 Drawbacks of Quantitative Easing

Potential drawbacks from Quantitative Easing could include:

- *Greater risk taking* - The new inflow of money into commercial banks from quantitative
easing has encouraged banks to use this extra money through greater risk-taking.
- *Bond traders have benefited* by manipulating the bond market.
- *Manipulating the exchange rate* - Quantitative Easing has been a way of reducing the value
of the currency to make exports cheaper.  This can lead to retaliation from other countries.
- *Impact on people's savings* - By depressing interest rates, quantitative easing has wiped out
people’s return on savings.  However, share price rises have compensated to a certain extent.
- *Quantitative Easing  can cause inflation*.
