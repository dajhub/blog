    <description><![CDATA[<p>When examining Oligopolies we often use the kinked demand curve to show how firms might face a dual demand curve (i.e. elastic and inelastic) for its product based on the likely reactions of other firms to a change in its price.  Game Theory can also be used by economists to gain a more detailed understanding of how oligopolies might operate in their market.</p>]]></description>
