    <description><![CDATA[bspwm is a tiling window manager along the lines of qtile and i3 . The window manager, bspwm, does not handle any keyboard inputs and a third party program, sxhkd , is needed in order to translate keyboard events to navigate around bspwm.
Most of my keyboard shortcuts are the default from &lsquo;sxhkd&rsquo;. However, there are a few additions which have made navigation much easier for me.
1. Rotate an application around the current desktop super + shift + {p,o} bspc node @/ -C {forward,backward} The keys &lsquo;p&rsquo; and &lsquo;o&rsquo; can be changed for whatever you prefer - they just work for me!]]></description>
